## Objective

Analyze the data available on the IMDb website for movies released in the cinema between 2006 and 2016.

## Dependicies

- Numpy:      It contains many functions for numerical computation.
- Matplotlib: It allows to trace and visualize data in the form of graphs.
- Pandas:     It allows to manipulate and analyze data (dataframes).
- Seaborn:    It complements Matplotlib by providing attractive statistical graphics.

## Conclusion

Loading ,preparation, wrangling of these data, then the visualization of these data with a wide variety of graphs, and finally the interpretation of these graphs made it possible to conduct an analysis and a global view of movies released in the cinema between 2006 and 2016.
